Title: Shortest Paths Between Points in Grids
Version: 1.1.2
Authors@R: person("Christian", "DÃ¼ben", email = "cdueben.ml+cran@proton.me", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Shortest paths between points in grids. Optional barriers and custom transition functions. Applications regarding planet Earth, as well as 
  generally spheres and planes. Optimized for computational performance, customizability, and user friendliness. Graph-theoretical implementation tailored 
  to gridded data. Currently focused on Dijkstra's (1959) <doi:10.1007/BF01386390> algorithm. Future updates broaden the scope to other least cost path
  algorithms and to centrality measures.
